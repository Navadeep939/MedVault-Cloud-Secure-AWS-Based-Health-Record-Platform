1️⃣# MedVault-Cloud-Secure-AWS-Based-Health-Record-Platform
MedVault Cloud is a secure AWS-based Personal Health Record platform that enables encrypted storage and controlled sharing of healthcare data. Built using Python, EC2, S3 with KMS encryption, IAM, VPC, and Terraform, it enforces fine-grained access control using RBAC and ABE principles.
2️⃣ #Problem Statement
Healthcare data is highly sensitive and requires strong security, controlled access, 
and regulatory compliance. Traditional systems lack fine-grained access control 
and scalable cloud security.
3️⃣ #Solution Overview
MedVault Cloud provides a secure platform where patients and healthcare providers 
can upload, store, and access health records securely. The system uses AWS-managed 
security services, role-based access control, encryption, and private networking 
to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.
